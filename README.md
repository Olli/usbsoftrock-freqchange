== Freqchange for usbsoftrock
If you use usbsoftrock you maybe want a simple but more comfortable
interface to change frequencies. This small script gives a little
bit more comfort than the commandline.
Note the multiplier for usbsoftrock is 4 - you have to change
it in the script manually or fork the script and implement a 
commandline parameter ;)
Have fun
