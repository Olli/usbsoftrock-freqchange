### Freqchange for usbsoftrock
If you use usbsoftrock you maybe want a simple but more comfortable
interface to change frequencies. This small cs  ript gives a little
bit more comfort than the commandline.
Note the multiplier for usbsoftrock is 4 - you have to change
it in the script manually or fork the script and implement a 
commandline parameter ;) 
The same applies for the frequency hop value - its 44.1 khz - if you need a greater value you have to change it.

Manual:
after startup you can use the arrow up and the arrow down key to 
change the frequency by the hop value up or down. 

If you write a number like 3.5 and hit enter the frequency is directly changed to this value.

q exits the tool. 


Have fun
